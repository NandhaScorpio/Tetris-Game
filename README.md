# Tetris Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game where players manipulate falling blocks called tetrominoes to create complete horizontal lines, which then disappear, earning the player points.

## Features

- **Basic Gameplay**: Control falling blocks (tetrominoes) using arrow keys to move left, right, and down, and the up arrow key to rotate the blocks.
- **Scoring**: Score points by completing horizontal lines. The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the board.
- **Block Types**: Different types of tetrominoes are used, each consisting of four squares.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the falling block horizontally.
3. Use the down arrow key to move the block down faster.
4. Use the up arrow key to rotate the block.
5. Aim to create complete horizontal lines with the falling blocks to clear them and score points.
6. The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the board.
